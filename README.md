# Food Delivery Chatbot Overview 🍔🤖

The Food Delivery Chatbot project is an intelligent system designed to streamline the process of ordering food through natural language conversation. Leveraging the Sequential() model of neural networks, this chatbot interprets user inputs, understands their food preferences, and facilitates a seamless food ordering experience.

## Key Features 🚀

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The chatbot employs advanced NLP techniques to comprehend user requests, enhancing the conversational experience.

- **Sequential() Model:** Built using the Sequential() model in neural networks, the chatbot adapts to various user inputs and provides relevant responses.

- **Food Ordering Assistance:** Users can easily specify their food preferences, receive recommendations, and complete the ordering process within the chat interface.

- **Intuitive Conversations:** The chatbot engages users in intuitive conversations, ensuring a user-friendly and interactive food ordering experience.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **Python:** Programming language used for developing the chatbot.
- **TensorFlow:** Deep learning library for implementing the Sequential() model.
- **Keras:** High-level neural networks API running on top of TensorFlow.

## Before You Begin 🛠️
